				<p>Its scientific name, Bradypus, is Greek for "slow feet," which makes sense since it is the world's slowest animal. It is so slow, in fact, that algae grows on its fur, according to National Geographics. The algae works to the sloth's advantage, though. The green of the algae helps the sloth blend into the trees, hiding it from predators.</p>
